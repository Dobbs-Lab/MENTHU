<p>A Guide to Writing Helpful Bug Reports</p>
<p>By Carla Mann, 09/21/2017</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In your bug report email, please include an email header with:</p>
<ol>
<li>The site you are using</li>
<li>The words &ldquo;Bug Report&rdquo;</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;Example of a helpful email header:</p>
<p><strong>MEDJED Bug Report: Site crashes when submitting lowercase sequence</strong></p>
<p>Example of a not-helpful email header:</p>
<p><strong>the website crashed</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the body of the email, please include:</p>
<ol>
<li>(Optional, but highly suggested) A polite or humorous salutation</li>
<li>The <strong>time you were using the site</strong>, and <strong>your time zone</strong></li>
<li><strong>Information necessary to reproduce</strong> the issue you found; examples include, but are not limited to:
<ol>
<li>Sequence(s) inputs</li>
<li>Radio buttons you selected</li>
<li>Checkboxes you selected</li>
<li>Dropdown menu choices</li>
<li>Button(s) you pressed</li>
<li>Any red error messages displayed on screen, after you put in your inputs</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>What you were doing when the error/crash occurred</strong> (e.g., pasting a sequence input, choosing a radio button, hitting submit, etc)</li>
<li><strong>What happened</strong> (e.g., did the website crash? Are you receiving a red error message you can&rsquo;t resolve? Are you not getting results?)</li>
<li>(Optional) A screenshot of what happened (e.g., error message, weird output, etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Example of a Helpful Bug Report:</p>
<p><img src="helpfulBugEmail.png" alt = "Helpful Bug Report Example"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For reference, a website crash looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="crash.png" alt = "Crash Example"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Red error messages look like this:</p>
<p><img src="errorMessage.png" alt = "Error Message Example"></p>
<p>Error messages appear in red. <strong>These are FEATURES, not bugs &ndash; these messages appear in order to let you know that there is an issue with one or more of your inputs that prevents you from getting results. </strong>Error messages will tell you what the problem with the input is, and give you an idea of how to fix the error(s). GTagHD, MEDJED, and MENTHU will not process inputs via the submit button if there are any red error messages present.</p>
